This is the project for creating a network Bridge.

High-Level Approach:
First, our program creates a network Bridge, based on the input IDs
and the given list of LANs for that bridge, using a virtual
setup. It creates socket connections for each LAN, and connects them
to our bridge as Ports (see Port.py). By doing this, we start by sending
out a BPDU to all socket connections, which will let every other
connected Bridge know it's information. It then receives messages from
the sockets, decides if they are a BPDU or a Data message, and decides
what to do with them from there.

Issues:
Many issues are being encountered. We are finding that we cannot successfully
connect multiple bridges together correctly, and this results in many lost
packages. This may have to do with the understanding of bridge designation,
port enable/disable activity, or BPDU forwarding.

Testing:
Did unit testing for JSON parsing into BPDUs and DataMessages.
For the rest, we used the testing suite that was provided for the assignment.
