This is the project for creating a Simple Bridge.

High-Level Approach:
First, our program creates a network Bridge, based on the input IDs
and the given list of LANs for that bridge, using a virtual
setup. It creates socket connections for each LAN, and connects them
to our Bridge. The sockets are held in a Port object (see Port.py).
By doing this, we start by sending out a BPDU (see BPDU.py) to all
socket connections, which will let every other connected Bridge know it's
information. It then receives messages from the sockets, decides if they
are a BPDU or a Data Message. The BPDUs are used to create a shortest-path
spanning tree to a 'root' bridge. The data messages are either broadcasted
or forwarded for enabled ports, or dropped for disabled ports.

Issues:
Many issues were encountered. We were finding that we could not successfully
connect multiple bridges together correctly, and this resulted in many lost
packages. This had to do with the understanding of bridge/port designation,
port enable/disable activity, and BPDU broadcasting. Eventually, we figured
out the correct logic, and iteratively improved on our Bridge, eventually
getting to succcessful package delivery.

Testing:
Did unit testing for JSON parsing into BPDUs and DataMessages.
For the rest, we used the testing suite that was provided for the assignment.
